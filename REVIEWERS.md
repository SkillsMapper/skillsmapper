# Instructions for Technical Reviewers

Thank you for taking the time to review the code from [Programming Cloud Native Applications with Google Cloud](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-cloud-native/9781098145071/).

The core of the book is six projects generally comprising a service that forms part of the Skills Mapper application. The purpose of these is to allow the reader to explore how Google Cloud services fit together and can be used in practice rather than just defining their purpose.

The intention also is not to teach the reader how to program but more focus on the Google Cloud functionality and configuration. All instructions are at the command line whenever possible to make it easier to follow in a book and hopefully the command line will stay more consistent than the Google Cloud Console.

What I would most appreciate is understanding anything that is unclear, anything that is under or over explained and most importantly anything that doesn't work from the instructions given alone. 

If you spot anything that is wrong or just a wierd way of doing things that would be great to know too. The intention is not to overwhelm the readers with pages of code listings but more point out the key concepts.

Configuration may become tedious in later projects especially Chapter 6. This is intentional as it will be followed by chapters on automation (Terraform & Cloud Build) and Observability.

## Getting Access to the Repository

The code is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/SkillsMapper/skillsmapper.

However, this is a private repository at the moment so please send me you GitHub username to [github@danielvaughan.com](mailto:github@danielvaughan.com) and I will add you as a collaborator.

When you have access please go to https://github.com/SkillsMapper/skillsmapper#readme for an explanation of how the projects are laid out.
