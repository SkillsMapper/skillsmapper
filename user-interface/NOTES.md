There are more scalable and cost-effective ways to host a UI on Google Cloud. In this chapter we will explore two options.

The first option is to use Google Cloud Run to host a UI. This is a serverless option that is cost-effective.

The second option is to use a Cloud Storage Bucket to host a UI. This is an even more cost-effective option.

We will also show how we can use Identify Platform to support authentication using Google Sign-In rather than using just a simple username and password.
