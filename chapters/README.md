# Chapters

When writing the book the actual asciidoc files are contained in a separate private repository. This directory contains symbolic links to asciidoc files for the chapters.

Similarly in each project directory there is a `chapters` directory that contains symbolic links to the asciidoc files for the relevant chapters. Without access to the private repository these links will not work.
